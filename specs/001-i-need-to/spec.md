# Feature Specification: QA Automation for Flutter App

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-need-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I need to build test that help to test the main functionalities of the default application in flutter, to make qa automations"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a QA engineer, I want to automate tests for the main functionalities of the Flutter app, so that I can ensure consistent quality across releases.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the default Flutter app, **When** a user navigates through the main screens, **Then** the automated tests validate the navigation flow.
2. **Given** the app's input fields, **When** a user enters valid and invalid data, **Then** the automated tests verify correct validation behavior.
3. **Given** the app's API integrations, **When** the app fetches data, **Then** the automated tests ensure data is displayed correctly.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the app is offline?
- How does the app handle invalid API responses?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST automate navigation tests for all main screens.
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate input fields for both valid and invalid data.
- **FR-003**: System MUST verify API data is displayed correctly in the app.
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle offline scenarios gracefully.
- **FR-005**: System MUST log test results for debugging and reporting.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **TestCase**: Represents a single automated test case, including steps, expected outcomes, and results.
- **TestReport**: Aggregates results of all test cases, including pass/fail status and logs.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04

- Q: Should tests include device-specific behaviors (e.g., Android vs. iOS)? ‚Üí A: Yes, include device-specific tests
- Q: Should tests simulate real-world network conditions (e.g., latency, packet loss)? ‚Üí A: No, assume ideal conditions
- Q: Should tests use real or mock data? ‚Üí A: Use mock data for tests
- Q: What specific functionalities of the Flutter app should be considered "main functionalities" for automation testing? ‚Üí A: All functionalities
- Q: How should the automated tests handle error states (e.g., invalid inputs, API failures) in terms of user feedback validation? ‚Üí A: Just a message error
